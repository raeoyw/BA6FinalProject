# BA6 Final Project: Number of Internet Users in North America Over Time

Project Description:
An interactive web application which shows a choropleth map of countries in North America, including Canada, USA, Mexico, and Greenland. The application features a time slider which allows the user to change the year between the ranges of 2000 and 2020, which updates the choropleth map to display the corresponding number of internet users in each country for the given year.
