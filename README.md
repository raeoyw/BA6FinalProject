# BA6 Final Project: Number of Internet Users in North America Over Time

Project Description:
An interactive web application which shows a choropleth map of countries in North America, including Canada, USA, Mexico, and Greenland. The application features a time slider which allows the user to change the year between the ranges of 2000 and 2020, which updates the choropleth map to display the corresponding number of internet users in each country for the given year.
<br>
<br>
Project Goal: The goal of this application was to illustrate how relatvely recently the internet has integrated into society to become a standard of everyday life. Using the time slider, the user is able to see how the number of internet users in North America has grown exponentially across just two decades. The user is also able to see that the US has been one of the quickest countries to adopt the internet, and that this standard of internet access is not universal, and there are disparities of internet access between countries, even just within this continent.
